* Introduction
  This document will illustrate design. 


* Design
  + ELK is used as a data store and is independent of the service
    willing to write into it.
  + ELK is running behind an nginx proxy server and hence all sorts of
    authentication, authorization, limting checks, security checks are
    applied in the nginx configuration.
  + ELK as a service is to be available to authenticated and
    authorized users/services. Each application must create its index
    and document.
  + A simple diagram showing a flow of how a service and ELK service
    will interact.
